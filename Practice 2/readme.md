1. There is the following code:

let x = 1;
let y = 2;

let res1 = // Add the code, it is necessary to use the variables x and y
console.log(res1); // "12"
console.log(typeof res1); // "string"

let res2 = // Add the code, it is necessary to use the variables x and y
console.log(res2); // "true2"
console.log(typeof res2); // "string"

let res3 = // Add the code, it is necessary to use the variables x and y
console.log(res3); // true
console.log(typeof res3); // "boolean"

let res4 = // Add the code, it is necessary to use the variables x and y
console.log(res4); // NaN
console.log(typeof res4); // "number"

Add the code so that the lines written in the comments appear in the browser console, while operating with the x and y variables.


2. The user enters a number (use prompt ()). It is necessary to check whether the entered number is correct
a) even positive;
b) a multiple of 7.
Display the result of the check in the console.

3. Create an empty array;
1) Write any number in the first element of the array;
2) Write any line in the second element of the array;
3) Write any logical value in the third element of the array;
4) Write the value null in the fourth element of the array;
5) Display the number of elements stored in the array;
6) Ask the user to enter any value and write this value in the fifth element of the array;
7) Display the fifth array element on the screen.
8) Delete the 1st element of the array and display the array on the screen.

4. Write a program that combines all existing elements of the array into a ribbon and separates them with the symbol "*".
Initial array:
let cities = ["Rome", "Lviv", "Warsaw"];
Result:
"Rome*Lviv*Warsaw"

5. Using the prompt() function, ask the user a question about reaching the age of majority. Record the result in the isAdult variable. Depending on the received value, display the appropriate message about the person's status. For example: if the condition is fulfilled, the age is more than 18, output "You have reached the age of majority". If the age is less than 18 years, display "You are still too young",

6. The user enters three lengths of the sides of the triangle (use prompt() three times to enter each side).
Necessary
a) determine and display the area of the triangle in the console
b) check whether this triangle is right-angled and display the result of the check in the console.
Check whether the values entered by the user are correct, otherwise display 'Incorrect data'. Output the result of the triangle area calculation to the console with 3 decimal places (for example: 8.42355465 => 8.424).

7. Write a conditional construction that, depending on the time of day, will output the appropriate greeting. You need to get the real time of day from the system. Do it in 2 ways through 2 different conditional operators.
In the range of hours 23-5 - the greeting "Good night" should be displayed
In the range of hours 5-11 - the greeting "Good morning" should be displayed
In the range of hours 11-17 - the greeting "Good day" should be displayed
In the range of hours 17-23 - the greeting "Good evening" should be displayed.
